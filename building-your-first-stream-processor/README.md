# Building your first Stream Processor

In this section, you will learn how to create your Atlas Stream Processing Instance, configure the connection registry, and create your first stream processor!  To get started, you will need the following:

* MongoDB Atlas account
* MongoDB Cluster (can be a free-tier) located in the same Project as your Atlas Stream Processing Instance
* MongoDB Database User (can be a new user used for just this tutorial)

While Atlas Stream Processing does not require an Atlas cluster, in this example, you will be streaming data from the solar stream sample data generator, which is an out-of-the-box connection that simulates real-time solar data, to an Atlas cluster located in the same project as the Atlas Stream Processor.&#x20;
