# Introduction

Consider what makes MongoDB one of the most popular data platforms in the world, the document model.  This model is based on JSON documents (technically, it is BSON, but for this text, let's refer to it as JSON).  What makes JSON great for development is that you can store anything without having to deal with rigid schemas.  If version 2 of your application added a "temperature" field, you don't need to break your downstream applications.  MongoDB not only stores JSON, it has developed a robust query language to query unstructured data called the [Query API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/query-api/). &#x20;

When dealing with streaming data, it often originates from various sources, each with its own schema. This unstructured nature makes MongoDB an ideal choice for querying such data. MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing enables the handling of high-velocity streams of complex data using the same [data model](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/data-modeling-introduction/#document-structure) and  [Query API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/query-api/) as MongoDB Atlas databases. Streaming data is becoming increasingly essential for creating responsive, event-driven experiences for your customers. Stream processing is a crucial building block for these applications, as it manages the vast influx of data from multiple sources, identifies significant events within a stream, and integrates data in motion with data at rest.

This book will deep-dive into Atlas Stream Processing, first providing a high-level architectural overview, followed by detailed text on key streaming capabilities, operational and security considerations, limitations, and lots of examples to help you get started!
